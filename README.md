# Ore
#### A small [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) workflow for quickly throwing together little web things.

It uses [Browsersync](http://browsersync.io) to autoreload on file changes, synchronize scrolls and clicks between browsers, and provide a [public URL](http://localtunnel.me) for easy cross-device development. It compiles, [autoprefixes](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer), and minifies [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/). Concatenates and uglifies JS. It has a default layout and page using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com). Easily deploy your project with a custom domain for free using [Surge](https://surge.sh).

## Installation

**1. Make sure [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) are installed.**

```
git clone https://github.com/jamiewilson/ore.git <folder-name>
```

_Or manually install by [downloading the ZIP](https://github.com/jamiewilson/ore/archive/master.zip)._

**3. Install the dependencies and create a global symlink with:**
